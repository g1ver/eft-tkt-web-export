# Discord Bot Data Export Tool

https://eft-tk-tracker-web-export.vercel.app/

## Project Overview
This web application was created to help users transition away from my deprecated Discord bot (EFT Teamkill Tracker). While the bot's services are being discontinued, I understand that some may want to export their data. This tool allows you to securely download your server's historical data in CSV format.

## Features
- Simple Discord OAuth2 sign-in
- Access to all your historical bot data
- Export data in CSV format
- View your servers where the bot was active

## How to Use
1. Visit the [website](https://eft-tk-tracker-web-export.vercel.app/)
2. Click "Sign in with Discord"
3. View or select the server whose data you want to export
4. Download your data in CSV format

## Technical Details
Built with:
- Next.js
